# ðŸ§¬ Bulk RNA-seq Workflow (Learning Project) for skeletal muscle

This is a **learning project**, where I built a complete RNA-seq pipeline from raw FASTQ files to gene counts.  
The goal was to practice all key steps of RNA-seq analysis and explore the expression profile of **human skeletal muscle**.

---

## ðŸš€ Pipeline steps

1. **Download data** â€“ [`scripts/00_download_data.sh`](scripts/00_download_data.sh)  
   Download raw FASTQ files from SRA using `prefetch` and `fasterq-dump`.  
   Download the GRCh38 reference genome (FASTA) and annotation (GTF).

2. **Quality control** â€“ [`scripts/01_qc.sh`](scripts/01_qc.sh)  
   Run FastQC on raw FASTQ files and summarize results with MultiQC.
   QC:
   - Slight drop in the first 10â€“12 bases (technical bias) 
   - Per-base quality > Q30 across most positions.
   - Small adapter contamination detected.
   - Duplication level high (typical for RNA-seq).

3. **Trimming** â€“ [`scripts/02_trim.sh`](scripts/02_trim.sh)   
   Remove technical bias (first 12 bp) and discard very short reads using `cutadapt`.  
   Re-run QC on trimmed data.

4. **Genome indexing** â€“ [`scripts/03_index.sh`](scripts/03_index.sh)  
   Build a HISAT2 index of the GRCh38 genome. 

5. **Alignment** â€“ [`scripts/04_align.sh`](scripts/04_align.sh)  
   Align trimmed RNA-seq reads to the GRCh38 genome using HISAT2.  
   Output: SAM file with alignment results. **~95%** overall alignment rate. Unique concordant alignments: **86.6%**

6. **SAM â†’ BAM conversion** â€“ [`scripts/05_sam_to_bam.sh`](scripts/05_sam_to_bam.sh)  
   Convert SAM to BAM, sort, and index with samtools.  
   Output: compact, ready-to-use BAM file.

7. **Quantification** â€“ [`scripts/06_counts.sh`](scripts/06_counts.sh)  
   Generate a count matrix with `featureCounts`. **~25.9M** reads assigned to genes.

8. **Exploratory analysis (R)** â€“ [`notebooks/muscle_exploration.R`](notebooks/muscle_exploration.R)  
   - Imported count matrix into R.  
   - Generated summary plots:  
     - **Expression distribution histogram** (log-scale).  
     - **Top 20 expressed genes barplot**.  
   - Verified that the most highly expressed genes are structural and contractile proteins specific to skeletal muscle (*TTN, NEB, ACTA1, MYH7, TNNT1, ACTN2, MYLPF*).

## ðŸ“Š Results

### Gene expression distribution
The histogram shows a typical RNA-seq pattern: most genes are expressed at low levels, while a small subset of highly abundant transcripts dominates the profile.

### Top expressed genes in skeletal muscle
RNA-seq profiling revealed strong expression of sarcomeric and contractile proteins, fully consistent with muscle biology.

### Conclusion
- The pipeline was successfully executed from raw FASTQ to gene counts with high-quality mapping (~95%).  
- Skeletal muscle showed **expected tissue-specific expression**: the most abundant transcripts were structural and contractile proteins (*TTN, NEB, ACTA1, MYH7, TNNT1, ACTN2*).  
- The expression distribution and top-gene profile confirm both the **technical validity** of the pipeline and the **biological specificity** of the skeletal muscle sample.
